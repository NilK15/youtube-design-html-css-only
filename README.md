# Youtube Front-End Responsive Clone - No Functionality Only Design!

### My attempt at copying the YouTube website design (non-functional). 

### Steps: 
* Screenshot taken of personal YouTube account's homepage. 

* Modified the image into nested layouts, color coded based on nested level. This aided in helping structuring the design.

* The SVGs were copied by inspecting the document of the real YouTube site, then pasting the <svg> element code  into newly created, local .svg files.

  `NOTE: Needed to add xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" in the <svg> tag of the newly created local .svg files.`
  
Thumbnail, channel, and account pictures were all retrieved in the same fashion, except these were saved as .jpg files instead of .svg.
