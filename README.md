# Youtube Front-End Responsive Site - Only Design Implementation! 

### My attempt at replicating the YouTube website design (non-functional) usingly purely HTML and CSS (and Google Fonts).

### Steps: 
1. Screenshot taken of personal YouTube account's homepage. 

2. Modified the image into nested layouts, color coded based on nested level. This aided in helping structuring the design.

3. The SVGs were copied by inspecting the document of the real YouTube site, then pasting the <svg> element code  into newly created, local .svg files.
  
4. Thumbnail, channel, and account pictures were all retrieved in the same fashion, except these were saved as .jpg files instead of .svg.


  `NOTE: Have to add xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" in the <svg> tag of the copied <svg> element when pasting into local .svg files, otherwise will not recognize SVG.`
