# Youtube Front-End Responsive Website - Only Design Implementation! 

### My attempt at replicating the YouTube website design (non-functional) usingly purely HTML and CSS (and Google Fonts).

### Design Structure Process:
1. Screenshot taken of personal YouTube account's homepage. 

2. Modified the image into nested layouts, color coded based on nested level. This aided in helping structuring the design. See image in `NestedLayoutDrawing` folder.

### Asset Retrieval:
1. The SVGs were copied by inspecting the document of the real YouTube website, then pasting the <svg> element code  into newly created, local .svg files. See `icons` folder.
`NOTE:` Have to add `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"` in the <svg> tag of the copied <svg> element when pasting into local .svg files, otherwise will not  recognize SVG.
  
2. Thumbnail, channel, and account pictures were all retrieved in the same fashion, except these were saved as .jpg files instead of .svg.

  
3. Used Roboto Google Font: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto - specifically the 500 and 700.
